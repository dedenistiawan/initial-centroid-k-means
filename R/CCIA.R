Algorithm CCIA (Cluster Center Initialization Algorithm)
Input: Dataset X with n data points, number of clusters k
Output: Initial cluster centers

1. Calculate the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) for each attribute in the dataset X.
2. Normalize the dataset X using the calculated mean and standard deviation.
3. For each attribute, partition the data into bins using the normal curve (e.g., using quantiles).
4. Initialize a set of candidate cluster centers:
  a. For each bin, compute the mean of the data points within the bin.
b. Collect all these means as candidate cluster centers.
5. Use k-means to cluster the candidate centers into k clusters:
  a. Randomly select k candidate centers as initial centers.
b. Assign each candidate center to the nearest initial center to form k clusters.
c. Recalculate the centroid of each cluster.
d. Repeat steps 5b and 5c until convergence.
6. Use density-based multi-scale data condensation (DBMSDC) to refine the candidate cluster centers:
  a. For each candidate center, calculate the density of its surrounding data points.
b. Condense data points with similar density patterns to form a refined set of candidate centers.
7. Select k initial cluster centers from the refined set based on their density and distance:
  a. Ensure the selected centers are well separated.
8. Return the selected k initial cluster centers.
